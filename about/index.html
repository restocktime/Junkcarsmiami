                        <p>Buy Junk Car Miami was founded in 2020 by lifelong Miami residents who saw a need for honest, reliable junk car removal services in our community. What started as a small operation helping neighbors in Coral Gables has grown into Miami-Dade and Broward County's most trusted junk car buying service.</p>
