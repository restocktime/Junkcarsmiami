                        <p>Yes, you can sell a car without title in Florida, but the process requires specific documentation and varies depending on your situation. Florida law provides several legal alternatives for vehicle owners who have lost their title or never received one.</p>

                        <div class="important-notice">
                            <h3>⚠️ Important Legal Notice</h3>
                            <p>While it's possible to sell without title, having proper documentation is always preferred. This guide covers legal alternatives only - never attempt to sell a stolen vehicle or misrepresent ownership.</p>
                        </div>

                        <h2>Situations Where You Might Not Have Title</h2>

                                <p>Most common situation - you had the title but it was lost, destroyed, or stolen.</p>
                                <strong>Solution:</strong> Apply for duplicate title from Florida DHSMV
                            </div>

                                <strong>Solution:</strong> Lien release documentation or payoff arrangements

                        </ul>

                        <h3>3. Court-Ordered Title</h3>
                        <p>When other methods aren't available:</p>
                        <ul>

                        </ul>

                        <h3>4. Bonded Title Process</h3>
                        <p>For higher-value vehicles without clear ownership:</p>

                            <li>Purchase surety bond for 1.5x vehicle value</li>
                            <li>Bond protects against future ownership claims</li>
                            <li>Required for vehicles worth over $1,000</li>
                            <li>Bond remains active for 3 years</li>
                            <li>More expensive but legally comprehensive</li>
