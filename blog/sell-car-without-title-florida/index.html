                    <h2>Why You Might Not Have Your Car Title</h2>
                    <p>Before diving into solutions, let's understand the most common reasons people don't have their car titles:</p>

                    <div class="reason-list">
                        <div class="reason-item">
                            <h3>📄 Lost or Misplaced Title</h3>
                            <p>The most common scenario. You had the title but it's been lost, damaged, or accidentally thrown away. This happens to about 40% of car owners at some point.</p>
                        </div>

                        <div class="reason-item">
                            <h3>🏠 Inherited Vehicle</h3>
                            <p>You inherited the car from a family member, but the title was never properly transferred to your name. This is especially common with elderly relatives' vehicles.</p>
                        </div>

                        <div class="reason-item">
                            <h3>🏦 Lien Complications</h3>
                            <p>The bank or finance company still holds the title due to an outstanding loan, or there's confusion about lien release documentation.</p>
                        </div>

                        <div class="reason-item">
                            <h3>🔄 Never Received Title</h3>
                            <p>You bought the car but the previous owner never provided proper title documentation, or there were issues with the transfer process.</p>
                        </div>
                    </div>

                    <h2>Legal Ways to Sell Without Title in Florida</h2>
                    <p>Florida law provides several legitimate alternatives to having the original title. Here are your options, ranked from easiest to most complex:</p>

                    <h3>Method 1: Apply for a Duplicate Title (Recommended)</h3>
                    <div class="method-detail">
                        <p><strong>Best for:</strong> When you previously had the title but lost it</p>
                        <p><strong>Cost:</strong> $75.25</p>
                        <p><strong>Time:</strong> 5-10 business days</p>

                        <h4>Step-by-Step Process:</h4>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Complete Form HSMV 82101 (Application for Duplicate Title)</li>
                            <li>Provide valid Florida driver's license or ID</li>
                            <li>Pay the $75.25 fee</li>
                            <li>Submit at any DMV office or by mail</li>
                            <li>Receive new title by mail</li>
                        </ol>

                        <div class="pro-tip">
                            <h4>💡 Pro Tip:</h4>
                            <p>You can expedite this process for an additional $10 fee if you need the title quickly for a sale.</p>
                        </div>
                    </div>

                    <h3>Method 2: Affidavit of Ownership</h3>
                    <div class="method-detail">
                        <p><strong>Best for:</strong> Older vehicles (10+ years) or cars worth under $1,000</p>
                        <p><strong>Cost:</strong> Notarization fee ($5-15)</p>
                        <p><strong>Time:</strong> Same day</p>

                        <h4>Requirements:</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Vehicle must be 10+ years old OR worth less than $1,000</li>
                            <li>No outstanding liens</li>
                            <li>Notarized affidavit stating your ownership</li>
                            <li>Bill of sale or other ownership evidence</li>
                        </ul>

                        <div class="warning">
                            <h4>⚠️ Important:</h4>
                            <p>This method only works for lower-value vehicles. Most buyers will want additional documentation for valuable cars.</p>
                        </div>
                    </div>

                    <h3>Method 3: Court-Ordered Title</h3>
                    <div class="method-detail">
                        <p><strong>Best for:</strong> Complex ownership situations</p>
                        <p><strong>Cost:</strong> $300-800 in court fees</p>
                        <p><strong>Time:</strong> 30-60 days</p>

                        <p>When other methods don't work, you can petition your local county court for an order establishing ownership. This provides the strongest legal protection but takes the longest.</p>
                    </div>

                    <h3>Method 4: Work with Licensed Dealers</h3>
                    <div class="method-detail">
                        <p><strong>Best for:</strong> Quick sales without paperwork hassles</p>
                        <p><strong>Cost:</strong> No upfront cost (built into offer)</p>
                        <p><strong>Time:</strong> Same day</p>

                        <p>Licensed auto dealers in Florida can legally purchase vehicles without titles when proper alternative documentation is provided. This is often the fastest and easiest option.</p>

                        <div class="dealer-benefits">
                            <h4>Benefits of Working with Licensed Dealers:</h4>

                    <h2>Special Situations and Solutions</h2>

                    <h3>Inherited Vehicles</h3>
                    <p>If you inherited the car from a deceased family member:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Small estates (under $25,000):</strong> Use Form HSMV 82101 with death certificate</li>
                        <li><strong>Larger estates:</strong> Probate court documentation required</li>
                        <li><strong>Multiple heirs:</strong> All heirs must sign transfer documents</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>Vehicles with Outstanding Loans</h3>
                    <p>If there's still a loan on the vehicle:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Contact the lender for payoff amount</li>
                        <li>Arrange for loan payoff from sale proceeds</li>
                        <li>Get lien release documentation</li>
                        <li>Some buyers will handle payoff directly with lender</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>Out-of-State Titles</h3>
                    <p>If the car was titled in another state:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Contact that state's DMV for duplicate title</li>
                        <li>Or transfer to Florida title first, then apply for duplicate</li>
                        <li>Some documentation requirements may differ</li>
                    </ul>

                            <p><strong>A:</strong> With proper documentation, you shouldn't get significantly less. Reputable buyers focus on the car's condition and value, not title complications. Expect 0-10% reduction at most with licensed dealers.</p>
